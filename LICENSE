 Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed

 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
